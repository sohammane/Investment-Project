## Project Brief:
Spark Funds, an asset management company which wants to make investments in a few companies. The CEO of Spark Funds wants to understand the global trends in investments so that she can take the investment decisions effectively.Spark Funds wants to invest where most other investors are investing. This pattern is often observed among early stage startup investors.We have taken real investment data from crunchbase.com, so the insights we get may be incredibly useful.

## Business and Data Understanding:
Spark Funds has two minor constraints for investments:

- It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment

- It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in.

## Business objective:
The objective is to identify the best sectors, countries, and a suitable investment type for making investments. The overall strategy is to invest where others are investing, implying that the 'best' sectors and countries are the ones 'where most investors are investing'.
